                <p>I have been helping small and large businesses improve their organic presence in Google
                    as a Search Engine Optimiser (SEO) for more than a decade. 
                    <br><br>I recently took an a new path and dedicate my free
                    time to learning web development and programming as part pf the SheCodes Plus programme.

                        <p>After teaching myself a beginner coding level and completing many online courses, I believe that no online learning programme can beat in-person collaboration, 1:1 tutoring and connecting with like minded women that share the same motivations!</p>

                        <p>From automating tasks, performing data analysis and reading CSV files, I had already fell in love with Python a few years ago as this programming language offers so many opportunities for SEOs! </p> 
                        <p>Python was the very first language we learnt as part of the programme and I enjoyed learning new concepts beyond the scope of what I knew for SEO such as creating objects (OOP) and working woth virtual environements.</p>
                        <p>Our end-of-module project involved processing CSV files containing raw data about the weather, and converting them into meaningful text-based summaries for human beings.</p>

                        <p>Before starting this module, the world of back-end and Django programming was completely foreign to me. </p>
                        <p>For a few weeks, we learnt how to create interactive 'dynamic' web pages in Python using Django web framework. This resulted in the creation of a news website that allows users to read news stories, authors to create them and many other cool features.</p>
                        <p>I had so much fun working on this project and used this project to write blog posts about each feature I built and all the Django things I've learnt along the way!</p>

                        <h3>First exposure to APIs</h3>
                        <p>As with the previous module, I had never been exposed to building web APIs before and absolutely loved learning, struggling and playing with API specifications and Database Schema.</p>
                        <p>Building on the learnings from previous months, the DRF module involved creating our own crowdfunding website and building an API to store and populate our website with users data.
                        Cool things I learnt along the way: how to create a MVP, how to plan design with Figma wireframes, how to build a Database Schema (<a href="https://lucid.app/lucidchart/072bc885-e7a7-48ff-8399-457072c1de4d/edit?invitationId=inv_e0f1b96c-cbd8-4737-b3d0-fc164901e301&page=0_0#" target="_blank">like here with LucidChart</a>) and how to create an API specification table, handling relationship models, etc.</p> 
                        <p>At the end of this module, the skeletton of the "PointJar" crowdfunding platform was created. The idea of PointJar is to help non-for-profits finance specific local projects using people's donations of their loyalty points, miles or cash. </p>

                        <h3>Setting the scene for what's coming</h3>
                        <p>Before getting our hands dirty with building the user interface of PoinJar, we spent a few weeks learning how to add interactive content using JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>I used to have a love/hate relationship with JavaScript: it's undeniably the most used programming language in the world, used as a client-side programming language by 97.0% of all websites, and yet it's always been quite challemging to SEO optimise a JS built website for Google. </p>
                        <p>While no specific project was born out of these few weeks of learning JavaScript, I did reconcile with this language, and this module gave us great fundations to grasp REACT concepts which came next.</p>

                        <p>Building on previous learnings, we learnt how to add interactive elements to our crowdfunding website using React, a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on user interface components.</p>
                        <p>Amongst the new things I've learnt during this module: how React Router work, how to get data from the API, how to post data to the API, how to deploy back-end and front-end on Heroku and so on!</p>

                        <p>I wish this group project never had to end... My amazing team and I worked relentlessly at creating a solution that solved our client's problem.</p>
                        <p>Our client runs in-person workshops all the time and uses a physical board to add students' sticky notes describing their "wins". One of the main problems was that the client didn't know how to make these "win walls" online and COVID-friendly.</p>
                        <p>Our solution was to take the wall of sticky note concept and digitize it. And Win{Wall} was born: an online collaboration tool that provides event organisers and their attendees an online workspace where they can add sticky notes to digital walls and share wins with others during live events</p>
                        <p>This fun project helped us reinforce all what we learnt during the She Codes programmes and got us better at designing wireframes using Figma (<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/cvP0Kc7lAX39Fvo12C5aLa/Win-Wall?node-id=0%3A1">see our initial design concept here</a>, using Github as a team, and deploying websites and API in Heroku.</p>
